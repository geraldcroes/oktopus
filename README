Oktopus is a PHP5.3+ engine that promotes loosely coupled systems.

At its very core, the Oktopus Engine is a flexible Autoloader BUT there's a LOT more to come, and you'll have to wait to see it in action :-)

For now, if you want the Oktopus to Autoload every classes in your application (whatever framework or library you're using), just do

<?php
include ('Oktopus/Engine.class.php');
Oktopus\Engine::start ('/tmp/');//gives the temporary path with write permissions

//That's all folks
